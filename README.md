# Magnetic V-Plotter
## Project Goals
1. Make and design a V-Plotter, similar to the one found [here](http://www.homofaciens.de/technics-machines-v-plotter_en.htm).
2. Have this plotter be novel in some way -- in this case it plots with a ball that is controlled from behind the drawing surface with a magnet.
3. Have the entire plotting mechanism be concealed inside of a picture frame, such that it looks very unique.
4. Develop methods to plot things as smoothly as possible.
5. Use several capacative sensors to allow for automatic calibration.
6. TODO: Have this be connected to a temperature sensor, so that this can plot a temperature function in real time for extended periods.

## Additional Notes
This is still a work in progress. A video that shows an early stage of my initial testing can be found [here](https://youtu.be/Jd8q3qR4iCs).
